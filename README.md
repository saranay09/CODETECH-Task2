OVERVIEW OF PROJECT:
PROJECT:STUDENT GRADE TRACKER
Develop a Python program to track and manage student grades. The
program should allow the user to input grades for different subjects or
assignments, calculate the average grade, and display the overall
grade along with any additional information (such as letter grade or
GPA).
Input Grades:

The get_grade_input function repeatedly prompts the user to enter grades until they type 'done'. It ensures grades are between 0 and 100.
Calculate Average:

The calculate_average function computes the mean of the list of grades.
Determine Letter Grade:

The determine_letter_grade function assigns a letter grade based on the average.
Calculate GPA:

The calculate_gpa function converts the average to a GPA on a 4.0 scale.
Display Results:

The main function ties everything together, displays the grades entered, and prints the average, letter grade, and GPA.
